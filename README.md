# DEVNET_EN2_GRSNW
Contains Docs and Labs about the DEVNET class

>We are following the course of `CISCO DEVNET ASSOCIATE` and are documenting all Labs.
>If the Lab is linked to a document in the class of cisco, the document will also be uploaded, otherwise it will be a pdf with instuctions and a md file with the documentation of the lab or its results.

>I hope this will help anybody who is working on the labs and if you have suggestions or corrections, i would be happy to adjust.
